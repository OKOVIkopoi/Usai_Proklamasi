# Usai Proklamasi: Same or Different
A (still under work) Mod of Autumn Chen/aucchen's [Social Democracy: Petrogad 1917](https://github.com/aucchen/petrograd_1917) game where you can play as any available party at the time of 1945, technically there's none which is why I'm working to put a spectator one that basicly lets you watch History as is until 'enough' parties spawn to be chosen by you or.. continue spectate.
## Included Libraries

[jquery v1.11.1](https://releases.jquery.com/)

[d3.js v7](https://d3js.org)

[d3-parliament](https://github.com/geoffreybr/d3-parliament)

## Building the game

1. Install [dendrynexus](https://github.com/aucchen/dendrynexus)

2. Run `dendrynexus make-html` in this folder.

## Commentary and other things the Modder wanna tell

This mod is still being work on, so yeah you shouldn't play it NOW. I advise you to wait till I announce the Mod is finally finished (v1.0) or this Readme is updated to inform that.

Current mode: Modder is offline or just at rest.
